        <title> Hey, travis is a faggot, and this is the title of the page

        </title>

    <body>
        <h1>Travis is still a faggot and this is the header for the page
        </h1>
            <p>He's definitely still gay, but this is the body of the page. and this is testing the paragraph tag to make sure that Im not retarded. Although, it's almost guaranteed that I am. I wonder how this will look on the page once our power stops flickering and I can actually connect to the internet. As suspected, I am retarded and cannot spell still. However everything displayed correctly so Ill take that as a win. Fuck line breaking in this, fucking stupid piece of shit.
